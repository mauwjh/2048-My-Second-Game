# 2048

## About
A remake of the iconic original 2048 game, with an added feature allowing the user to select the number of squares on the board.

## Tech Stack
This site was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

**Libraries**: jQuery 

## User Story
1) Users may shift tiles by using the arrow keys while on desktop or swiping on mobile.
2) Every turn, a new tile appears at a random empty position on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
3) Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by another tile or reach the edge of the board.
4) If two tiles of the same value collide, the tiles are merged and the values are summed.
5) The resulting merged tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.
